    <p>
    I enjoyed my time at <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en">Ericsson</a>  <br/>
    I enjoyed my studies at the <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/">Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)</a>.  <br/>
    I enjoyed my time working for the IT department of <a href="https://www.su.se/">Stockholm University</a>.  <br/>
    I enjoyed my time at Nanoradio and my time at Samsung after they aquired us.  <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
    Now a new chapter dawns and I tought I would try something new.  <br/>
    So as of 2015 I am a freelance developer. <br/>
    Lets have some fun... <br/>
